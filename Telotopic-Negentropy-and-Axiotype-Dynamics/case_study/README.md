# Case Study – Vectorial Affective Dynamics

This folder contains the full case study associated with the article *"Affective Forces and the Structure of Interaction"*.

## Contents

- `actor_phase_diagrams/` — 8 vectorial plots representing the affective state of two actors (A and B) across 4 phases.
- `generate_diagrams.py` — the Python script that produced the diagrams.
- This README.

## Notes

Each plot shows Fc and Fi vectors, labeled and scaled, projected against a shared telos. The evolution is diachronic and actor-specific.
