# Actor-Phase Diagrams

This folder contains 8 diagrams (4 phases × 2 actors) showing the vectorial alignment of conative and inhibitory forces (Fc and Fi) with the shared telos direction.

## Contents

- `phase1_A.png` → Initial position of Actor A
- `phase1_B.png` → Initial position of Actor B
- `phase2_A.png` → Reaction of A to new constraint
- `phase2_B.png` → Emotional inhibition in B
- ...

## Notes

Each diagram displays:
- Fc and Fi vectors with labels
- Alignment or divergence with the telos
- Color-coded arrows and annotations

These plots were generated using `generate_diagrams.py`, using vectorial data from `vectors.csv`.
