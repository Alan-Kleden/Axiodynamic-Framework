# Negentropy Evolution Across Phases

This folder contains:

- `evolution_around_phases.py`: the Python script generating the trajectory plot of telotopic negentropy.
- `telotopic_negentropy_trajectories.png`: the resulting visual output.

These resources support the diachronic modeling of affective alignment through conative and inhibitory vectors.
