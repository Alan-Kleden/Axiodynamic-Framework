# Affective Projection Angle – Θ

This folder illustrates how an affective vector (Fc) is projected onto the telos to compute the alignment angle (Θ).

## Files

- `projection_angle_theta.py` — Python script to generate the illustrative plot.
- `projection_angle_theta.png` — The corresponding visual output.

## Description

The angle Θ between a conative vector (Fc) and the telos is computed using vector projection.  
This construction is foundational to the telotopic negentropy model used throughout this article.
