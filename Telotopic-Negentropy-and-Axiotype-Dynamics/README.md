# Telotopic Negentropy and Axiotype Dynamics

This folder contains scripts, data, and visualizations for the article  
**"Affective Forces and the Structure of Interaction: A Telotopic Model of Negentropic Organization"**.

The telotopic framework models affective decision-making by representing conative (Fc) and inhibitory (Fi) forces as vectors oriented toward a shared telos.  
Telotopic negentropy is used as a metric for coherence and directional alignment over the course of interactions.
