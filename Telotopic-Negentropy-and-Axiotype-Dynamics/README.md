# Telotopic Negentropy and Axiotype Dynamics

This folder contains scripts, tools, and visual outputs related to the modeling of telotopic organization through axiodynamic principles.

The telotopic approach models collective affective alignment using vectorial representations of conative (Fc) and inhibitory (Fi) forces, oriented toward a shared telos. Negentropy is used as a metric for coherence and directional convergence across individuals and interactional phases.

## Subfolders

### üìÅ `negentropy_evolution/`

This subfolder includes:

- A Python script to compute and visualize telotopic negentropy across multiple phases of a social interaction.
- A resulting figure that illustrates the evolution of alignment over time.
- A local README detailing the logic of the script and how to reproduce the output.
